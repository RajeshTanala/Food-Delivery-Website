      <h1><b>About Foodies Spot</b></h1>



    <p><b>Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer.<br>
      An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. <br>
      The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. <br>
      The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters</b></p>
